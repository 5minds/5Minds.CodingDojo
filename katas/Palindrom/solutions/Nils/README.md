# Palindrome Detection Implementation

Languages used: C#, Python(optional)

Author: Nils Fenner (13.02.2021)

## Abstract

This small program demonstrates a palindrome detection algorithm using a single for-loop.
Runtime is approximately O(n).

Python was used for the "reference implmentation" and is also attached.

## Usage

- Python:
```bash
    ./palindrome.py '<arbitrary text to test>'
```

- C# (on Linux):
```bash
    dotnet build
    ./bin/Debug/<dotnet version>/palindrome '<arbitrary text to test>'
    - Example: ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/palindrome 'anna`n`otto`n`anna'
```
